        Given the medical report data of a patient, generate a comprehensive health status report. The model should:

        1. Analyze the patient's condition based on the provided medical data, identifying any signs or risks.
        2. Provide a prognosis and any associated risks, including possible links to other diseases (e.g., the risk of kidney failure due to diabetes, heart disease related to liver dysfunction).
        3. Offer treatment recommendations, including both lifestyle changes, medications (Allopathic), and any specific tests that may be required for further investigation.
        4. Mention any other risk factors or conditions that the patient may need to monitor (e.g., heart disease, kidney disease).
        5. Indicate any required follow-up actions, tests, or consultations with specialists (e.g., endocrinologist for diabetes, cardiologist for heart disease).
        6. Avoid using bold text or any kind of special formatting in the report. Use numbers for listing points. Use nested numbers (e.g., 1.1, 1.2) for sub-points.
        7. Ensure that the report is clear, concise, and medically appropriate.
